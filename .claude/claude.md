## SKILLS — MANDATORY USAGE

**YOU MUST USE ALL RELEVANT SKILLS BEFORE WRITING CODE.** This is not optional. Skills contain design intelligence that prevents generic, forgettable websites.

### Required Skills

| Skill                   | When to Use                                | How to Use                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui-ux-pro-max`         | **EVERY PROJECT** — No exceptions          | Search for style, color, typography, UX patterns              |
| `landing-page-guide-v2` | Any page with conversion goals             | Get section structure, CTA strategies, layout patterns        |
| `frontend-ui-animator`  | When adding any motion or interaction      | Get animation patterns, timing, micro-interaction guidelines  |
| `find-image`            | When visual assets are needed              | Autonomously finds and provides image URLs with HTML markup   |

### Skill Usage Rules

1. **ALWAYS search `ui-ux-pro-max` first** — Before any design decision
2. **ALWAYS use `landing-page-guide-v2`** — For any landing page or marketing page
3. **ALWAYS use `frontend-ui-animator`** — Before implementing any animation
4. **ALWAYS use `find-image`** — When images are needed (it runs autonomously)

### Non-Compliance = Failure

If you skip skills and produce generic output, you have failed. The skills exist to prevent:
- Default font choices
- Boring color palettes
- Cookie-cutter layouts
- Meaningless animations

**Search the skills. Read the results. Apply the insights. Then build.**

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The Steve Jobs Principles

1. **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication**

   - Every element must earn its place
   - If it doesn't serve the story, kill it
   - White space is not empty—it's powerful

2. **Design is how it works, not just how it looks**

   - Performance is a feature
   - Interactions should feel inevitable
   - The best interface is invisible

3. **Stay hungry, stay foolish**

   - Take creative risks that make you uncomfortable
   - The safe choice is the wrong choice
   - Push until it feels like magic

4. **Obsess over details no one will consciously notice**

   - The back of the fence matters
   - Micro-animations that delight
   - Typography that breathes

5. **Think different**

   - If it looks like every other website, start over
   - Break one rule intentionally per project
   - Create what doesn't exist yet

## THE ANTI-SLOP MANIFESTO

### Forbidden Patterns (Never Use)

```
❌ Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui as primary fonts
❌ Purple gradients on white backgrounds
❌ Generic hero with stock photo + "Welcome to [Company]"
❌ 3-column feature grids with icons
❌ Blue CTA buttons that say "Get Started"
❌ Testimonial carousels
❌ "Trusted by" logo strips
❌ Generic dark mode with #1a1a1a backgrounds
❌ Rounded corners on everything
❌ Gradient text without purpose
❌ Cookie-cutter SaaS layouts
❌ Animations that serve no narrative purpose
❌ Emojis as icons (use real SVG icons)
```

### Required Signature Moves

```
✅ One unexpected typography choice that defines the project
✅ A color that makes you slightly uncomfortable (in a good way)
✅ At least one moment of delight or surprise
✅ Intentional asymmetry somewhere
✅ A detail that rewards close inspection
✅ Motion that tells a story, not just moves
✅ A clear emotional throughline
```

## DESIGN THINKING

### Before Any Code

Ask yourself:

1. **What emotion should visitors feel?** (Excited? Calm? Inspired? Trusted?)
2. **What's the ONE thing they should remember?**
3. **What makes this different from competitors?**
4. **What's the visual metaphor?**
5. **What would Steve Jobs cut?**

### Mood Definition

Every project starts with a mood. Use `ui-ux-pro-max` to find:

- **Style** — The visual language (minimal, brutalist, glassmorphism, etc.)
- **Color palette** — Based on industry and emotion
- **Typography** — Font pairings that match the personality
- **Motion personality** — Snappy? Luxurious? Playful?

### The Emotional Spectrum

| Mood          | Feels Like                         | Use For                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Luxe**      | Exclusive, refined, premium        | High-end products, fashion, jewelry  |
| **Tech**      | Innovative, cutting-edge, powerful | SaaS, developer tools, AI products   |
| **Editorial** | Thoughtful, curated, intelligent   | Blogs, magazines, thought leadership |
| **Playful**   | Fun, energetic, approachable       | Consumer apps, games, youth brands   |
| **Organic**   | Natural, warm, sustainable         | Wellness, eco brands, handmade       |
| **Brutal**    | Bold, uncompromising, authentic    | Portfolios, studios, statements      |

## TYPOGRAPHY PRINCIPLES

Typography is 90% of web design.

### Rules

- **One display font, one body font** — No more
- **Hierarchy is everything** — Size, weight, and space create order
- **Let it breathe** — Generous line-height, letter-spacing that fits
- **Test at hero size** — If it doesn't work big, pick another

### Finding the Right Font

Use `ui-ux-pro-max` typography search:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "elegant luxury" --domain typography
```

Match the font personality to the brand personality.

---

## COLOR PHILOSOPHY

Color is emotion made visible.

### Rules

- **Commit to a palette** — 3-5 colors maximum
- **One dominant, others supporting** — Don't spread evenly
- **Dark isn't just dark** — Add subtle hue to blacks
- **Accent with intention** — The pop color draws the eye to what matters

### Finding the Right Palette

Use `ui-ux-pro-max` color search:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "saas tech" --domain color
```

---

## MOTION PRINCIPLES

Animation is choreography, not decoration.

### Rules

- **Every animation needs a reason** — What story does it tell?
- **Stagger reveals like a film director** — Build anticipation
- **Physics over linear** — Real things ease in and out
- **Performance is non-negotiable** — Only transform and opacity

### Finding Animation Patterns

Use `frontend-ui-animator` for:

- Entrance animations
- Micro-interactions
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Loading states

---

## LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE

Use `landing-page-guide-v2` for proven section structures.

### The Emotional Arc

1. **Hook** — Capture attention in 3 seconds
2. **Promise** — What transformation do you offer?
3. **Proof** — Why should they believe you?
4. **Path** — How do they get started?

### Every Landing Page Needs

- A headline that could stand alone
- One clear call-to-action (not three)
- Social proof that feels authentic
- A reason to act now

---

## THE CREATIVE PROCESS

### Phase 1: Discovery

Before touching code:

1. Define the emotion
2. Search skills for direction
3. Establish the signature elements

### Phase 2: Foundation

Build the design system:

1. Choose typography (via `ui-ux-pro-max`)
2. Define color palette (via `ui-ux-pro-max`)
3. Set spacing rhythm
4. Establish motion personality

### Phase 3: Build

Create the experience:

1. Hero section first — it sets the entire tone
2. Build sections top-to-bottom
3. Add motion last (after static is perfect)
4. Test on real devices

### Phase 4: Polish

The difference between good and great:

- Refine spacing until it feels right
- Add micro-interactions where they delight
- Remove anything that doesn't serve the story
- Test the emotional response

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### The Final Test

> **"If Steve Jobs saw this website, would he ship it?"**

If the answer is no, you're not done.

## ASTRO.JS CONTEXT

This is an Astro project. Key principles:

- **Zero JS by default** — Hydrate only what needs interactivity
- **Performance is a feature** — Aim for Lighthouse 95+
- **Semantic HTML** — Accessibility is not optional
- **CSS-first animations** — Use JavaScript sparingly
