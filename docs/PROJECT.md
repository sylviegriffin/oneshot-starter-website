# Project Brief

## What I'm Building

Landing page for a corporate burnout recovery coaching service. One-on-one coaching for executives and high-performers who are experiencing burnout but can't afford to slow down.

## Target Audience

- Senior managers, directors, and C-suite executives (35-55 years old)
- High-achievers who have pushed too hard for too long
- People who feel guilty about being burned out ("I should be grateful for my success")
- They value discretion, efficiency, and results
- They don't want therapy — they want practical strategies that work with their demanding schedules

## Desired Mood / Feeling

**Calm strength.** Not soft and fluffy wellness vibes. Not corporate and cold either.

The feeling should be: "Finally, someone who gets it. Someone who speaks my language but offers a way out."

Think: high-end executive retreat meets evidence-based performance coaching.

Keywords: grounded, sophisticated, trustworthy, quiet confidence, breathing room

## Key Message

**You don't have to choose between your ambition and your wellbeing.**

Recovery isn't about doing less — it's about leading differently.

## Specific Requirements

### Must-have sections:

1. Hero with a headline that speaks directly to the pain
2. "Is this you?" section — symptoms they'll recognize
3. The approach — what makes this different from therapy or typical coaching
4. About the coach — credibility + humanity
5. How it works — simple 3-step process
6. Testimonials — anonymous but specific (executives won't share publicly)
7. FAQ — address objections (time, cost, "I should handle this myself")
8. CTA — book a confidential call

### Tone notes:

- No toxic positivity ("You've got this!")
- No corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage")
- No guilt or shame about success
- Acknowledge the real constraints they face
- Permission to prioritize themselves

### Technical:

- Must feel premium but not flashy
- Mobile-first (they'll look at it on their phones during late nights)
- Fast loading — they have no patience
- Dark mode option would be nice (easier on tired eyes)
